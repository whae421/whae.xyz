My name is Jiho Kang.
I'm a student studying business administration at Seoul National Univ., South Korea.
This is my personal website powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on Github Pages, using [Mixyll](https://github.com/saikiransripada/mixyll) for the theme.

This Jekyll theme was completed by [Sai Kiran Sripada](https://www.saikiransripada.com/), for more info: [Github repository](https://github.com/saikiransripada/mixyll)
